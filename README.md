# HSI-CyberPatriot-Script-2022-2023
These are scripts we (@tovo1011) made to use during the 2021-2022 CyberPatriot competition, specifically geared towards the Windows 10 machines.

This year for the 2022-2023 CyberPatriot competition, I am updating the scripts, according to recorded faults in our experience, to make them more efficient.
They will be applicable to Windows Server 2019 machines as well.
Scripts relating to securing Linux distributions may be included, but at a later date.
